# Minimum Operations
Is a method that calculates minimum operations to achieve 'H' characters.

## Overview
This python script provides a method `minOperations(n)` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to achieve exactly 'n''H' characters in a text file. The allowed operations are "Copy All" and "Pate."

## Method
The `minOperations(n)` method uses dynamic programming to find minimum number of operations needed for each position up to the target 'n' characters. It iterates through the possible positions, considering the divisiblity reationships to calculate the minimum operations required.
